3. Learning goals, maybe we can add “factorizing” as another learning goal so that we can make more mini-games (e.g., gcd, lcm)
games about writing a fraction in lowest terms and about finding the least common denominator

Final Learning Goals:

- Must find all factors of whole number between 1 ~ 100 (completely factorize)

We are teaching through two game modes:
- Fireball game / waterdrop game
- Prime number guessing game
